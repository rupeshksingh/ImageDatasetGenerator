A student's guide to Global Climate Change Geothermal Energy If you were to dig a big hole straight down into the Earth, you would notice the temperature getting warmer the deeper you go. That's because the inside of the Earth is full of heat. This heat is called geothermal energy. People can capture geothermal energy through: Geothermal Power Plants At a geothermal power plant, wells are drilled 1 or 2 miles deep into the Earth to pump steam or hot water to the surface. You're most likely to find one of these power plants in an area that has a lot of hot springs, geysers, or volcanic activity, because these are places where the Earth is particularly hot just below the surface. How It Works Geothermal Heat Pumps Not all geothermal energy comes from power plants. Geothermal heat pumps can do all sorts of things\u2014from heating and cooling homes to warming swimming pools.

Solar energy will play a key role in our fight against climate change. But not everyone who wants solar energy can install rooftop panels.  Now there's an easier way for everyone to participate: Community solar.  What Is Community Solar? Community solar (also called shared solar or roofless solar) is a growing way that homeowners and renters alike can receive the financial benefits of solar energy\u2014without the hassle of upfront costs or installing your own solar panels. With community solar, renewable energy is more accessible than ever\u2014allowing more communities to enjoy clean power.  How Does Community Solar Work?

In a special IPCC 2011 report[1] several estimates are presented for the world total potential of ocean wave energy resources. These estimates were obtained using methods as illustrated in Appendix A. The theoretical maximum has been estimated at about 30,000 TWh/yr (3.1013 kWh/yr), which is about 20% of the 2019 world energy consumption. However, due to technological and economic constraints, the exploitable resource is almost a factor 10 less.  Ocean waves offer a greater consistency and are more predictable than solar or wind energy. Although the variability in wave power levels is large, waves containing harvestable energy are able to generate power up to 90 percent of the time, far outperforming wind or solar power devices[3]. The global distribution of mean wave power over the oceans is shown in Fig.1. Regions with the highe",
